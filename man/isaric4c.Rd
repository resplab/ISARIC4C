\arguments{
\item{age}{a vector of patient's age, male (1) or female(0)}

\item{sex}{a vector of patient's gender}

\item{num_comorbidities}{number of comorbidities (Chronic cardiac disease; chronic respiratory disease (
excluding asthma); chronic renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¤30); mild-to-severe liver disease;
dementia; chronic neurological conditions; connective tissue disease; diabetes mellitus (diet, tablet or
insulin-controlled); HIV/AIDS; malignancy; clinician-defined obesity.)}

\item{respiratory_rate}{respiratory rate in breaths per minute}

\item{admission_oxygen_saturation}{peripheral oxygen saturation on room air (\%)}

\item{glasgow_coma_scale}{a vector of Glasgow coma scale score}

\item{urea}{urea concentration in mmol/L}

\item{crp}{CRP in mg/L}

\item{nosocomial}{symptom onset or first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR more than 7 days after admission. yes as 1, no as 0}

\item{radiographic_chest_infiltrates}{radiographic chest infiltrates, yes as 1, no as 0}

\item{receiving_oxygen}{whether a patient is receiving oxygen when oxygen saturation measured}

\item{lymphocytes}{lymphocyte count (* 10^9/L)}

\item{func}{a vector of function specification: either mortality as 0 or deterioration as 1}
